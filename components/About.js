        I&apos;m just a high school student. But I&apos;ve got a mind for tech,
        making it simple for those who need it. Space? Yeah, that fascinates me.
        The science, the mystery—it&apos;s all part of the pull. Whether I&apos;m
        on my own or not, I never stop learning and creating cool things.
        I have a love-hate relationship with school—dislike it, but appreciate
        it for the friends it brings.
